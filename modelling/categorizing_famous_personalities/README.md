# Analyzing and Categorizing Instagram users throughout NLP
===========================================================

Analyzing and categorizing influencers is an essential task to generate useful and handy recommendations to companies for their marketing campaigns. Different approaches include either content-based categorization approaches; in which influencers are categorized based on their content, or audience-based approaches in which demographics and interests of followers are used to categorize them. Brand collaboration approaches are also widely used to categorize influencers. In this code I show you a hybrid approach combining both content-based categorization and audience-based approaches to generate powerful classifications that can be used to generate recommendations to companies interested in acquiring influencers for their campaigns. We Data_scrapping techniques to gather data, will be using NER (Named entity recognition) to extract hidden data, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to categorize our influencers and sentiment analysis techniques to identify useful patterns in influencers data.
